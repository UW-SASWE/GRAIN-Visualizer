            The GRAIN dataset and its associated source code, documentation, and sample workflows are provided solely
            for research, academic, and educational use. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy,
            integrity, and consistency of the dataset, the developers make no warranties, express or implied, regarding
            the completeness, correctness, or suitability of the data for any particular purpose.
        </p>

        <h2>By using the GRAIN dataset, you acknowledge and agree to the following:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The developers, contributors, affiliated institutions, and data providers shall not be held liable for any
                direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use, inability to use,
                misinterpretation, or misuse of the dataset or associated tools.
            </li>
            <li>
                The dataset may contain inaccuracies, omissions, or artifacts due to limitations in source data (e.g.,
                OpenStreetMap completeness, satellite products, or machine-learning classification errors). Users are
                responsible for independently verifying results before applying them in decision-making contexts.
            </li>
            <li>
                If GRAIN is used for operational, engineering-critical, emergency response, navigation, hydrological
                forecasting, legal, or regulatory purposes, users are strongly advised to conduct additional independent
                validation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any downstream analyses, publications, or decisions based on GRAIN are the sole responsibility of the

        </ul>

        <p>
            If you discover errors, inconsistencies, or have suggestions for improvement, we encourage you to submit
            them through the project's GitHub repository to help strengthen future versions of the dataset.

            By accessing or using GRAIN, you accept this disclaimer and agree that the dataset is provided "as is," without
